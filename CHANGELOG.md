# Release Notes

## Initial 2023.1 release

This is a new curriculum in the iSAQB Advanced Series.

It includes theoretical underpinnings, design methodology, and tools
and techniques for implementing _domain-specific languages_ or _DSLs_.

DSLs are part of many software products.  They have significant impact
on architecture and quality attributes such as adaptability,
modifiability, analysability, and security.

Consequently, the architecture benefits when DSLs are done right.
Unfortunately, many DSLs in the wild are designed ad-hoc with
insufficient consideration of architectural implications.

Our hope is that this curriculum will lead to more systematically
constructed DSLs that will enable robust and beautiful architecture.
