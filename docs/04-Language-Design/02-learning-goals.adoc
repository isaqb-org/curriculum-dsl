[[LG-4-1]]
==== LG 4-1: General Design Issues

* Know the difficulty of good language design, and its impact on
  architectural decisions, in particular whether to implement an
  embedded or stand-alone DSL, and whether to re-use design or
  implementation elements from existing languages.

* Understand the impact of changes in language design on a software
  system, and how they relate to changes elswhere in an existing
  architecture.

[[LG-4-2]]
==== LG 4-2: Type systems

* Understand the basics of type systems, including type inference.
* Know various design criteria for a type system and practical examples, such as Java and Standard ML.
* Know how to leverage a host or target language's type system to build a type system for a DSL, and alternatively know the basic principles behind designing a dedicated type system.
* Understand the trade-offs between a typed and untyped DSL.
* Understand the concept of overloading, specifically as it applies to
  primitive values (overloading integers, etc.), and its role in
  designing embedded DSLs.

[[LG-4-3]]
==== LG 4-3: Compositional Domain Modeling

* Understand the concept of compositionality - that the meaning of a
  compound entity only depends on the meaning of its components, not
  their internal structure
* Understand the value of compositionality for domain modelling.
* Understand the relationship between the ideas of "closure of
  operations" in Domain-Driven Design and compositionality
* Know construction principles for (compositional) combinator libraries.
* Understand how compositionality (or its absence) manifests itself in
  DSL design.
* Know examples from real projects where compositionality is a crucial
  aspect of DSL design.

[[LG-4-4]]
==== LG 4-4: Effects

* Understand the concept of effects.
* Know examples for reader, writer, state, and control effects.
* Understand the concept of a continuation.
* Know typical examples of effects in typical DSLs.
* Know implementation techniques for effects, specifically some
  that allow dependency injection.
* Understand the relationship between effects and hexagonal
  architecture.
