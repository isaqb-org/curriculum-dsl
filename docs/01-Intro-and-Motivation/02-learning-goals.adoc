[[LG-1-1]]
==== LG 1-1: Requirements and Architectural Relevance

* Know possible requirements and conditions that might make a DSL a
  sensible architectural decision, such as an insufficiently
  expressive implementation language, the need for complex
  user-defined rules, the need to restrict behavior of parts of the
  software, or the need to make parts of the software analysable in
  non-trivial ways.

* Understand that the design of a DSL - including its syntax - may
  have far-reaching consequences for a project, as it will impact its
  intended quality goals, including its usability, and will be harder
  to change the more code is written in the DSL.

[[LG-1-2]]
==== LG 1-2: Definitions

* Know the basic terms in the context of domain-specific languages: parser, compiler, interpreter, syntax, lexical syntax, abstract syntax, semantics, run-time, compile-time.
* Know the taxonomy of DSLs regarding types, embedded/stand-alone, interpreted/compiled.
* Understand the difference between a general-purpose programming language and a domain-specific language.

[[LG-1-3]]
==== LG 1-3: Basics of modelling

* Understand the connection between the business domain and the design of a domain-specific language.
* Know the basic principles of Domain-Driven Design and how they relate to domain-specific languages.
* Know how to identify possible applications of domain-specific languages in a given business domain.

[[LG-1-4]]
==== LG 1-4: Embedded vs. Stand-Alone DSLs

* Understand that there is a spectrum between library design and
  language design, with no clear boundaries.
* Understand that designing and implementing a DSL does not have to be
  a singular decision, but can progress gradually along that spectrum
  until an economic and organizational sweet spot is reached.
