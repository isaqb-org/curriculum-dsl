[[LG-1-1]]
==== LG 2-1: Syntax and language design

* Understand that syntax is a matter of both ergonomics and taste, and
  thus the subject of requirements.
* Know that it is possible to adopt the syntax of an existing
  language.
* Understand that it is possible to embed a DSL into a host
  language, avoiding (part of) syntax design altogether.

==== LG 2-2: Formal grammars

* Understand the difference between lexical and structural syntax.
* Understand regular and context-free grammars.
* Understand the role of parsers, and restrictions on grammar
  structure imposed by parsers.
* Understand the difference between LL and LR parsing algorithms.
* Know the Chomsky hierarchy.

==== LG 2-3: Concrete and abstract syntax

* Understand the role of abstract syntax in processing DSL language
  elements.
* Understand the difference between concrete and abstract syntax.
* Understand the difference between traditional syntax of text-based
  languages along with the associated tooling, and projectional editing.
* Understand the stratified design of syntax in Lisp-like languages.

==== LG 2-4: Embedding into a host language

* Understand that there is a spectrum between library design and
  language design, with no clear boundaries.
* Understand the role of macros in designing domain-specific syntax in
  Lisp-like languages.
