[[LG-5-1]]
==== LG 5-1: Syntax tools
* Understand the mode of operation of parser and scanner generators.
* Know at least one tool for generating parsers, or an embedded DSL
  for parsers, such as
  link:https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/[Bison],
  link:https://www.s48.org/essence/[Essence],
  link:https://www.antlr.org/[ANTLR], or
  link:https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec[Parsec].

[[LG-5-2]]
==== LG 5-2: Semantics tools
* Understand the relationship between interpretation and code
  generation.
* Know how to establish an informal connection between the desired
  semantics of a DSL and the actual implementation, such as via
  automated and systematic testing, or tools provided by a host
  language.
* Know at least one tool for specifying and executing the formal
  semantics of a DSL using modelling and specification languages such
  as link:https://redex.racket-lang.org/[PLT Redex] or
  link:https://github.com/ott-lang/ott[Ott].
* Know at least one tool for supporting the design of a type system
  such as link:https://redex.racket-lang.org/[PLT Redex] or
  link:https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/typesystem-debugging.html[Typesystem Trace].

[[LG-5-3]]
==== LG 5-3: Languages
* Understand the properties of programming languages that facilitate
  implementing DSLs: abstraction, overloading, extensible syntax.
* Understand the role of macros in DSLs design.
* Know the concepts of staging and hygiene relevant for the use of
  macros.
* Know at least one host language conducive to implementing embedded
  DSLs such as link:https://racket-lang.org/[Racket],
  link:https://www.haskell.org/[Haskell],
  link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/[Ruby] or
  link:https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin].

[[LG-5-4]]
==== LG 5-4: Development Environments
* Understand the relationship between syntax and IDE functionality.
* Understand what requirements IDE tooling has of the language
  infrastructure, in order to provide syntax support, code navigation,
  and refactoring.
* Know of the existence of tools to automate the creation on IDE
  functionality such as link:https://racket-lang.org/[DrRacket],
  link:https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/[Xtext],
  link:https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/[MPS] or
  link:https://www.spoofax.dev/[Spoofax].
